A Blockchain based Wedding Registry Platform

## About the Project

Registering for a wedding in India is an immensely complex and time-consuming process, to make it hassle-free, we simplified it by creating the decentralized  platform to solve many crucial problems like:
Communal Limitation- In India we face various backlashes and problems when we try to marry someone from different caste or religion and even due to their gender as  people belonging to LGBTQ+ couldn't even register their wedding as it's not legal which creates inequality in the society, through our website we are giving them a platform to register their wedding.
Paperwork - Filling forms and taking two witnesses to the court on a set date, along with supporting documents like the wedding invitation card and photos. It seems like a never-ending process but we make it easier just by adding your unique keys, you will get the certificate in your mails.
NFT(Non-Fungible Tokens)- As a wedding gift or souvenir, you can gift NFTs to your loved ones i. e. transform digital artworks into unique verifiable digital assets that are tradable on the blockchain whose value will keep increasing over time.  
Smart Lawyer- Will help you out regarding your wedding registry, preparing the affidavit, creating prenup statements, or any other concerns.
Prenups- Prenups or Prenuptial Agreement is an extra service for those who want to manage their financial assets, liabilities, possessions, etc before getting married and further prevent them from getting into legal hassles that might occur in case of divorce, mutual separation, child custody, child maintenance, alimony, etc.
